ElasTool is an automated toolkit for calculating the second-order elastic constants (SOECs) of any crystal systems belonging to two- and three-dimensional. It can utilize three kinds of strain-matrix sets, the high-efficiency strain-matrix sets (OHESS) [1], the universal linear-independent coupling strains (ULICS) [2] and the all-single-element strain-matrix sets (ASESS) [1] to calculate the SOECs automatically. In an automatic manner, ElasTool can deal with both zero- and high-temperature elastic constants.

Presently, ElasTool interfaces to VASP package for calculating the accurate stresses of strained crystal. But the interfaces to other DFT packages can also be easily implemented.
